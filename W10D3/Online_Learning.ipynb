    "## Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms are batch learners meaning they generate a model by learning on the entire dataset at one time. Not surprisingly, these algorithms are the most well known and most used. However, there is another class of algorithms known as online learning algorithms. Instead of learning on the entire dataset at once, data is consumed in sequential order as it becomes available. Said another way, online learning is a way to dynamically update a model in real-time according to the most recent data. For a more detailed discussion, see [Online Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both batch and online learning have advantages and disadvantages. This should come as no surprise to anyone who has dabbled in machine learning. Rarely if ever do you get something for nothing; there are always tradeoffs. For a discussion on the pros and cons, see [this](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-offline-vs-online-learning) Quora post.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "---\n",
    "Now that that's out of the way, let's walkthrough how to implement an online learner in Scikit-learn. First, let's introduce the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Iris dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris)  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Boston dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iris dataset is a famous, canonical classification dataset. See the docs for details. The Boston dataset is a canonical regression dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The Iris dataset has 3 classes. This is not ideal. Introducing online learning with a binary class problem would have been better but that requires sourcing a binary dataset and likely going through preprocessing. Therefore, I decided that although 3 classes - which will require a One-Versus-All (OVA) approach - is not ideal, it made sense in my mind to keep the data ingestion process as streamlined and as simple as possible. Hence, why I chose to load both datasets from Scikit-learn.*\n",

    "You likely have several questions at this point. Hopefully I can preemptively address some of them here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** *When should I use batch learning and when should I use online learning?*  \n",
    "**A:** Use batch learning unless: \n",
    "1. Your data does not fit into memory \n",
    "2. You expect your data to change significantly over time (though retraining over a sliding window can help batch)  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** *How do I tune an online learning algorithm?*  \n",
    "**A:** The answer depends on your use case. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume you're using online learning because your data doesn't fit into memory. In that case, you can follow the standard practice of splitting your data and tuning your hyperparameters with cross-validation. If you expect your data to change significantly over time, splitting your data may not be feasible. In this case, you can leverage [progressive cross-validation](http://hunch.net/~jl/projects/prediction_bounds/progressive_validation/coltfinal.pdf) and run multiple models to ascertain which set of hyperparameters is likely to generalize best. If your model is in production, that's a whole different story. Then you really need to rely on someone with expertise in these types of algorithms. As an aside, it's often the case that a hybrid batch and online learning approach is used in production instead of solely relying on online learning.\n",

    "Batch and online learning are two common approaches to machine learning. With batch, sometimes called offline learning, all data is consumed to build a model. In contrast, online learning algorithms consume single observations. Batch is more common. However, there are many use cases for online learning. For example, online learning shines when data is too large to fit into memory or you expect the distribution of your data to drift over time. Furthermore, online learning is typically very fast, and once data has been consumed it's really not needed anymore. Those can of course be great benefits but like all things in machine learning, you have to make sure your approach makes sense for your use case. "
